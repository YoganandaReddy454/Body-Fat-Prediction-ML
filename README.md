## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to predict **body fat percentage** using machine learning techniques by analyzing various body measurement features. It involves **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, **feature engineering**, **data preprocessing**, and training ML models to estimate body fat percentage with high accuracy. 

The dataset contains body composition and anthropometric data of individuals including their age, weight, height, and circumference measurements like abdomen, wrist, hip, etc.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Perform exploratory data analysis on the body fat dataset.
- Identify and remove outliers.
- Train multiple machine learning models.
- Evaluate and compare model performance.
- Predict body fat percentage for new individuals.
